Multiple Linear Regression
Now you know how to build a model with one X (feature variable) and Y (response variable). But what if you have three feature variables, or may be 10 or 100? Building a separate model for each of them, combining them, and then understanding them will be a very difficult and next to impossible task. By using multiple linear regression, you can build models between a response variable and many feature variables.
Let's see how to do that.
